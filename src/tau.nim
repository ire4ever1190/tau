##
## Tau is high/low level wrapper around `Ultralight <https://ultralig.ht/>`_
##
## The main difference between low/high level is that you need to manually destroy objects when using the low level api.
## Procs for both levels are named similarly except the creation procs which have `ul` prefix for low level
